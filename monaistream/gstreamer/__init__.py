This module contains code for GStreamer related components and plugins. It contains the utility definitions for use with
extension classes as well as Python based plugins which can be loaded with the gst-python module. This module requires
a list of directories be provided in the environment variable GST_PLUGIN_PATH. In these directories it looks for a 
subdirectory called "python" in which it expects plugin source files to load. This module adds its directory to this
variable and has a "python" symlink linking to its directory so that this mechanism works on import.
